You need more technical and management resources. You need a lot of them and very soon. You could opt for head-hunting or you could try outsourcing. However, if you are savvy enough, there is a better way: Team as a Service®.</p></p></div></div><div class="paragraph"><div class="left"> <img src="http://img.teamed.io/image4.png"></div><div class="right"><h1>Go Distributed</h1><p><p>We give you a distributed team of highly qualified programmers, all working remotely from their home countries. We assign them tasks and monitor their performance. We take responsibility for the end result and milestones.</p></p></div></div><div class="paragraph"><div class="left"> <img src="http://img.teamed.io/image3.png"></div><div class="right"><h1>Outstanding Quality</h1><p><p>Due to our unique management model, we can deliver much higher quality than many other software teams. First, our rules are very strict: Initial unit tests, mandatory static analysis, pre-flight builds and on-time delivery. Second, we pay only for deliverables that pass our quality checks. This combination ensures outstanding results.</p></p></div></div><div class="paragraph"><div class="left"> <img src="http://img.teamed.io/image7.png"></div><div class="right"><h1>Targeted Skills</h1><p><p>Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, we have the luxury of choosing from a vast talent market only those professionals specifically required for your project. If it needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers just to cover our expenses. Unlike most software teams, programmers are not a burden to us.</p></p></div></div> </article></section> <footer class="normal"><p class="left"> <strong>email</strong> <a href="mailto:sales@teamed.io">sales@teamed.io</a><br/> <strong>phone</strong> 860.506.5536</p><p class="right"> Team as a Service is provided by <a href="http://www.technoparkcorp.com">TechnoPark Corp.</a> and is its registered trademark.</p> </footer> <script>var _gaq=_gaq||[];_gaq.push(["_setAccount","UA-1963507-34"]),_gaq.push(["_trackPageview"]),function(){var t=document.createElement("script");t.type="text/javascript",t.async=!0,t.src=("https:"==document.location.protocol?"https://ssl":"http://www")+".google-analytics.com/ga.js";var e=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];e.parentNode.insertBefore(t,e)}()</script></body></html>
